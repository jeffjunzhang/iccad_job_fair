      title: "Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together."
      abstract: "We will present CheckList, a task-agnostic methodology and tool for testing NLP models inspired by principles of behavioral testing in software engineering.\n
\n
We will show a lot of fun bugs we discovered with CheckList, both in commercial models (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) and research models (BERT, RoBERTA for sentiment analysis, QQP, SQuAD). We'll also present comparisons between CheckList and the status quo, in a case study at Microsoft and a user study with researchers and engineers. We show that CheckList is a really helpful process and tool for testing and finding bugs in NLP models, both for practitioners and researchers."
